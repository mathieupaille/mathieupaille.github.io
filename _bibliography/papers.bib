This paper brings to the literature on homogeneity an independent difference between pluralities and atoms, namely their behaviour with conjoined predicates. I show that the theory of homogeneity based on an excluded-middle presupposition produces unwanted results for conjunctions predicated of atomic subjects. I suggest that subatomic homogeneity is in fact the result of covert exhaustivity, which strengthens predicates in positive sentences},

	abstract = {Some formal investigations of specifiers have suggested that, if a phrase has multiple specifiers and one of these specifiers is thematic (i.e., externally merged), this thematic specifier is necessarily the lowest one. This ‘thematic-lowest’ hypothesis has been used to explain extraction facts in Tagalog (Rackowski and Richards 2005). The present paper brings in new data to the discussion on specifiers, namely the ‘pivot-third’ word order found in many Austronesian languages. I suggest a new analysis for it, according to which pivots in pivot-third languages tuck in to Spec-VoiceP. They end up below the thematic specifier, rather than above it. If accepted, this analysis casts doubt on the generalization that thematic specifiers must be lowest among a maximal projection’s specifiers.},

Rather, it is the result of a previously undescribed exhaustivity effect. What is more, this class of exhaustivity effects displays novel behaviour. Exhaustivity is both obligatory and tightly constrained: at first approximation, any taxonomic predicate must be in the immediate scope of the exhaustivity operator it requires. Taxonomic predicates, in this sense, are argued to ‘control’ exhaustivity.},

This paper considers the apparently simple question of whether this totality is the result of lexical meaning, or whether it is derived through semantic computation. Based on data from conjunction and additive particles, I argue that colour terms are lexically partial, not total. I therefore follow the spirit of Levinson (1983) in arguing that totality is the result of exhaustivity. However, I also show that a number of meanings predicted by an exhaustivity account of totality are not intuited. Rather, colour terms' exhaustivity is constrained in a previously unobserved way: colour terms must be in the immediate scope of the Exh operator.},

	pdf = {Paillé-2020.pdf},
	html = {https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/afla/aflaxxvi/},
	abstract = {This paper discusses a construction in colloquial Malay where VSO word order obtains together with a morpheme, <em>=nya</em>, on the verb. This V=<em>=nya</em> construction is argued to mark broad focus. Syntactically, it sheds light on the existence of an information-structural head between Voice and T in colloquial Malay. This is the head the verb moves to in every clause; in V=<em>=nya</em>, the arguments stay in situ, yielding VSO word order. Specifically, the head is a Cat(egoricality) head, which identifies its specifier as the sentence’s subject of predication (Cardinaletti 2004). The morpheme <em>=nya</em> is argued to be an expletive subject, merged to satisfy an EPP feature, precisely when all arguments are in situ in V<em>=nya</em>. Hence, Malay displays overtly an expletive subject that is lower than the derived subject position of Spec-TP, coinciding with the hypothesis that English-type languages generate expletives lower than the derived subject position, too.}

	Year = {2019},
	pdf = {Paillé-Schwarz.pdf},
	abstract = {The truth conditions of <i>know whether</i> reports – statements that feature the matrix predicate <i>know</i> embedding a polar question – have not been a matter of controversy (Karttunen 1977, Lewis 1982, Groenendijk and Stokhof 1982). What does not seem to have been observed, however, is that negated <i>know whether</i> reports are judged to convey more information about the agent's beliefs than received wisdom leads one to expect. For example, <i>Aisha doesn't know whether Ben is Canadian</i> is expected to merely convey that Aisha does not know the true answer to the embedded question, but it is actually understood to more specifically convey that Aisha is unopinionated about which answer to the embedded question is true. We will examine the prospects of relating such <i>agent</i> ignorance implications of negated <i>know whether</i> reports to <i>speaker</i> ignorance implications that have been described for both affirmative and negative <i>know whether</i> reports (Eckardt 2007, Egré 2008). We show that both types of ignorance implications are amenable to a derivation as quantity implicatures under neo-Gricean assumptions. However, we also find that, surprisingly, agent ignorance inferences are more pervasive than the corresponding speaker ignorance implications, even though the neo-Gricean account would at best be consistent with the opposite pattern. This suggests that agent ignorance implications of negative <i>know whether</i> reports are not in fact Gricean inferences, but part of the conventional meaning of such sentences.},
