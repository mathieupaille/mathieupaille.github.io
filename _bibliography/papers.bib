	abstract = {Some formal investigations of specifiers have suggested that, if a phrase has multiple specifiers and one of these specifiers is thematic (i.e., externally merged), this thematic specifier is necessarily the lowest one. This ‘thematic-lowest’ hypothesis has been used to explain extraction facts in Tagalog (Rackowski and Richards 2005). The present paper brings in new data to the discussion on specifiers, namely the ‘pivot-third’ word order found in many Austronesian languages. I suggest a new analysis for it, according to which pivots in pivot-third languages tuck in to Spec-VoiceP. They end up below the thematic specifier, rather than above it. If accepted, this analysis casts doubt on the generalization that thematic specifiers must be lowest among a maximal projection’s specifiers.},

	abstract = {While predicates in taxonomies (e.g. colour terms) are interpreted as mutually incompatible, this paper shows that their incompatibility is in many cases not lexical. Rather, it is the result of a previously undescribed exhaustivity effect. What is more, this class of exhaustivity effects displays novel behaviour. Exhaustivity is both obligatory and tightly constrained: at first approximation, any taxonomic predicate must be in the immediate scope of the exhaustivity operator it requires. Taxonomic predicates, in this sense, are argued to ‘control’ exhaustivity.},

	Year = {2020},
	pdf = {Paillé-2020.pdf},
	html = {https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/afla/aflaxxvi/},
	abstract = {This paper discusses a construction in colloquial Malay where VSO word order obtains together with a morpheme, <em>=nya</em>, on the verb. This V=<em>=nya</em> construction is argued to mark broad focus. Syntactically, it sheds light on the existence of an information-structural head between Voice and T in colloquial Malay. This is the head the verb moves to in every clause; in V=<em>=nya</em>, the arguments stay in situ, yielding VSO word order. Specifically, the head is a Cat(egoricality) head, which identifies its specifier as the sentence’s subject of predication (Cardinaletti 2004). The morpheme <em>=nya</em> is argued to be an expletive subject, merged to satisfy an EPP feature, precisely when all arguments are in situ in V<em>=nya</em>. Hence, Malay displays overtly an expletive subject that is lower than the derived subject position of Spec-TP, coinciding with the hypothesis that English-type languages generate expletives lower than the derived subject position, too.}
