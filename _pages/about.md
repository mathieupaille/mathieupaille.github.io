I'm a postdoctoral researcher in linguistics at the University of Calgary. I completed my PhD in 2022 as a <a href="https://vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Vanier scholar</a> at McGill University.

In <a href="https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/006765">my dissertation</a>, I show that the meaning of predicates as intuited in sentences is stronger than their lexical-conceptual meaning, and that the way this strengthening occurs has some special properties. In discussing the semantics of predication and strengthening, I also touch on the topics of additive particles, conjunction, and homogeneity.

In my spare time I enjoy studying languages, social movement organising, and time outdoors. I'm a native French speaker from a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Manitoban">minority community</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>.
