I'm a postdoctoral researcher in linguistics and <a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/2024-2025-eng.html">Banting fellow</a> at <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/">ZAS</a>. I specialize in semantics and pragmatics.

Most of my work focuses on exhaustification, predicate meanings, and the relation between language and thought. I'm interested in using the tools of formal semantics to learn more about how language interacts with other aspects of cognition, such as conceptual representations. For example, <a href="http://mathieupaille.github.io/assets/pdf/Paille-2025-LP.pdf">I have argued</a> that in most sentences, there are systematic mismatches between the intuited and underlying meanings of conceptual vocabulary like nouns and adjectives.

Previously, I was at the University of Calgary as a postdoctoral researcher, and at McGill as a Vanier scholar, where I defended <a href="https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/006765">my thesis</a> in 2022.

In my spare time I enjoy studying languages, social movement organising, and time outdoors. I'm a native French speaker from a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Manitoban">minority community</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, Canada.
