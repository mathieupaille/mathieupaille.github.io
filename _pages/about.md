I'm a fourth-year PhD student in linguistics and Vanier scholar at McGill University. I'm interested in syntax and meaning, especially issues of word order, focus and focus particles, and comparative grammar. I've worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language">Ojibwe</a> (Algonquian) and Austronesian (in particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language">Bahasa Malaysia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebuano_language">Cebuano</a>).

I'm currently working on a project on exhaustivity [<a href="/assets/pdf/Paillé-WCCFL38.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/assets/pdf/Paillé-SALT30.pdf">2</a>], in which I claim that there are predicates which (almost) always co-occur with an exhaustivity operator, and this operator is (almost) always local to the predicate in question. This has the effect of making it appear that the meaning is lexical, but it's in fact the result of exhaustivity.

In my spare time I enjoy playing violin, studying languages, and things like canoeing and skiing. I'm a native French speaker from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>.
