I'm currently completing a PhD in linguistics as a <a href="https://vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Vanier</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanier_Canada_Graduate_Scholarships">scholar</a> at McGill University. This fall, I will be heading to the University of Calgary as a postdoctoral researcher.

My dissertation is a project on exhaustivity [<a href="/assets/pdf/Paillé-WCCFL38.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/assets/pdf/Paillé-SALT30.pdf">2</a>], in which I claim that grammatical strengthening is regularly at play in the meaning of predicates. The exhaustivity is syntactically constrained in necessarily being local to the predicate, making its effect appear virtually lexical.

Beyond my work in semantics, I'm also interested in  syntax, especially with capturing word order variation across languages. I've done syntactic or semantic/pragmatic work on the Algonquian language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language">Ojibwe</a> and a couple Austronesian languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language">Bahasa Malaysia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebuano_language">Cebuano</a>).

In my spare time I enjoy studying languages, social movement organising, and things like canoeing and skiing. I'm a native French speaker from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>.
