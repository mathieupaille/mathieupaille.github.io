I'm a postdoctoral researcher in linguistics at the University of Calgary. I recently completed a PhD as a <a href="https://vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Vanier</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanier_Canada_Graduate_Scholarships">scholar</a> at McGill University.

In <a href="https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/006765">my dissertation</a>, I claim that grammatical strengthening (exhaustivity) is regularly at play in the meaning of predicates. The exhaustivity is syntactically constrained in necessarily being local to the predicate, making its effect appear virtually lexical. In discussing the semantics of predication and exhaustification, I also touch on the topics of additive particles, conjunction, and homogeneity.

Beyond my work in semantics, I'm also interested in  syntax, especially with capturing word order variation across languages. I've done syntactic or semantic/pragmatic work on the Algonquian language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language">Ojibwe</a> and a couple Austronesian languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language">Bahasa Malaysia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebuano_language">Cebuano</a>).

In my spare time I enjoy studying languages, social movement organising, and things like canoeing and skiing. I'm a native French speaker from a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Manitoban">minority community</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>.
