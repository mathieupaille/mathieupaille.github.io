I'm a <a href="https://vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html">Vanier</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanier_Canada_Graduate_Scholarships">scholar</a> and fifth-year PhD student in linguistics at McGill University. I'm interested in meaning and sentence structure.

My dissertation is a project on exhaustivity [<a href="/assets/pdf/Paillé-WCCFL38.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/assets/pdf/Paillé-SALT30.pdf">2</a>], in which I claim that grammatical strengthening is regularly at play in the meaning of predicates. The exhaustivity is syntactically constrained in necessarily being local to the predicate, making the effect appear virtually lexical. From this exhaustivity effect, we learn interesting things both about the distribution of exhaustivity, and about the relationship between predicates and the concepts they refer to.

Beyond this project, I'm also interested in  syntax, especially with capturing word order variation across languages. I've done syntactic or semantic/pragmatic work on the Algonquian language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language">Ojibwe</a> and a couple Austronesian languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language">Bahasa Malaysia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebuano_language">Cebuano</a>).

In my spare time I enjoy playing violin, studying languages, social movement organising, and things like canoeing and skiing. I'm a native French speaker from a minority community in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>.
